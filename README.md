## Autostudy Python Exercises (Beginner) :snake:

This scripts was resolved with the only purpose for study and practice

## Getting Started 

Python program can be done in two ways: calling the Python interpreter with a shebang line, and using the interactive Python shell.

### Prerequisites

You have installed Python itself. If you’re using macOS or Linux, your computer already has Python installed. You can get Python from [Link](python.org). For this exercices Python version 3.7

A Python IDE to preference to work with PyCharm CE or Professional

### Installing

**Configure a system Python interpreter**

Choosing which interpreter to use for a project is an important decision. Python is a script language, which means that your code is converted to machine code by a Python interpreter.

You can have multiple versions of Python installed on your computer, and you need to choose the one you’d like for this project. Note that you can always change your mind later and specify another interpreter for your project.

### Deployment

This repo contains: one branch called "Master",  includes 3 directories with proposed exercises resolved in Python scripts with .py extension defined as follows:

- HackerRank Exercises (If-Else, Loops, Swap Case, String Split and Join, String Formatting)
- Exercises 1 Video (Max Value, Mean function and Print Data scripts) 
- Exercises 2 Video (Email input validation, odd numbers and Password validation)
- Module exercises (Import statement, Locating Modules)
- External Files Exercises( Json data conversion into a Python object, functions)
